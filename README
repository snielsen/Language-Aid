Language Aid

What you have here is the last supported version (1.2) of Language Aid (http://www.aorensoftware.com/LanguageAid/index.html) with all the Deadlock DRM (http://www.aorensoftware.com/Deadlock/index.html) stuff removed and registration checks turned off. It is presented here as open source software (MIT license, see below) for whatever purpose you want. 

The Xcode project files all function and you can muck around that way or if you want to build and package the whole thing you can run the "latestcopy.pl" script found at the root of the project.
